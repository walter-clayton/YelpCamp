# YELPCAMP

I built this app to practice my frontend and backend skills. 

This is a web app that allows users to share campgrounds from all over the world. 

I enjoyed making this app, I previously used PHP and MySQL to make a website. I found Node.js and MongoDB a lot more modular in its usage, allowing me to add more features such as flash and passport authenticator. 

The biggest problem was the password reset. I am able to send a reset mail to the user but then the reset token doesn't recognise the user.
